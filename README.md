# Data-Driven Strategic Recommendations and Business Report

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to deliver data visualization solutions using Tableau and drive business insight for a credit card division at a large bank in Germany. The goal is to identify credit card customer profiles that are more risky or less risky based on certain variables such as age and existing credit. The project involves building an interactive dashboard with visualizations that provide insights into client risk profiles.

## Business Problem

As the risk manager for the credit card division, it is crucial to identify customer profiles that pose higher risk (bad clients) or lower risk (good clients) to the bank. Management has expressed a special interest in understanding how age and existing credit impact the risk profiles of customers.

## Data Source

The "German credit card" dataset is used for this analysis. It contains information about various attributes of credit card customers, including age, existing credit, and a target variable indicating whether the customer is considered good or bad.

## Approach

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
2. **Tableau Dashboard Creation**:
   - Build an interactive dashboard with at least 2 charts/sheets that are linked together.
   - Visualize different client profiles based on risk level, age, and existing credit.
3. **Visualization Techniques**:
   - Utilize filter actions to connect charts and enable interactive filtering.
   - Implement hover actions to provide additional details on data points.
   - Incorporate reference lines with interactive parameters to highlight key insights.
4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Document business insights derived from the visualizations.
   - Provide strategic recommendations for managing customer risk profiles based on the analysis findings.


## Business Insights

- The visualization shows a clear distinction between good and bad clients based on age and existing credit.
- Younger clients with lower existing credit tend to have a higher risk profile.
- The risk profile improves with increasing age and higher existing credit.
- Management can use these insights to develop targeted strategies for acquiring and managing credit card customers.

## Conclusion

The Tableau dashboard provides valuable insights into credit card customer risk profiles based on age and existing credit. By leveraging interactive visualizations, the bank's management can make data-driven decisions to mitigate risk and optimize customer management strategies.
